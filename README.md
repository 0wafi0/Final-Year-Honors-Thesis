# Final-Year-Honors-Thesis

Bachelors Of Engineering (Honors) (Computer and Software Systems)

This Repo includes the entirety of my final year thesis

Due to the complexity and Non Disclosure I am unable to provide working source code that can be ran on you local system.

Description:
"QUT is currently working with a number of industry partners in deploying techniques in a live environment to monitor crowd size
dwell time, and throughput rates; which are aggregated by a web server to display current and historic crowd information to users.
This project will investigate the development, testing and deployment of new analytics and/or the development of web based
visualizations to explore the data. 

Crowd surveillance is crucial as it can help prevent possible threats and large scale
incidents. The size of a crowd in a certain place, that is abnormal and different to what is usually expected can easily be a
sign of danger. Someone waiting for too long at a kiosk may indicate sinister motives or threat. Abnormal flow of pedestrian at
certain point can indicate that people are trying to run from something dangerous. Hence, these sorts of algorithms are vital in
providing adequate security.

Currently a live system is deployed in the Gold Coast Airport, and the focus of this project will be
dedicated to such system. The main focus of this project is in improving current inefficient algorithms within the system,
implement new crucial features and improve existing ones.

Currently emphasis is put into implementing a Support Vector Machine driven algorithm to estimate kiosk dwell times.
The current algorithm is not as efficient as it could be. This is to overcome current limitations such as noise and inaccuracies that maybe caused by the un-predictability of peopleâ€™s positioning.
Support Vector Machine is a type of discriminative classifier that labels data on a hyperplane.
The rationale behind it is to use features to train the Support Vector Machine for kiosks when they are occupied vs when they
are not occupied. This will allow the Support Vector Machine to then predict whether a frame is occupied or not on its own.
The following analysis explores limitations and downfalls of the developed prototype and how it can be improved for future
implementation and deployment. It also assesses feasibility and successes achieved."

The repository will include a demo video of how successful the SVM was, the source code used, and the thesis report.
